## Notes

App can be viewed working [here](https://eager-elion-34412e.netlify.app/).

Using `async` and `fetch` to call [API](https://www.reddit.com/top.json).

Using 10 posts at a time with 'load more' capability.

Consuming UNIX date from API and using relative date from `moment.js`.

Using 0.5 `opacity` to mark posts as read.

Using `keyframes` in CSS to animate post deletion.

Hiding ‘View Detailed Post’ below a certain resolution to make better use of smaller screen real estate.

Branches `master` and `main` got mixed up at some point but everything should be up to date in `main`.

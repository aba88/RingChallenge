## Notes

App can be viewed working [here](https://eager-elion-34412e.netlify.app/).

Using `async` to call [API](https://www.reddit.com/top.json)

Using 10 posts at a time (can limit this to 50 only and remove the load more button if necessary)

Consuming UNIX date from API and using `moment.js’` relative date

Using 0.5 `opacity` to mark posts as read

Using `keyframes` in CSS to animate post deletion

Hiding ‘View Detailed Post’ below a certain resolution to make better use of smaller screen real estate.
